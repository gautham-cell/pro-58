<h3>Coding is the language of the future and it has its own syntax and grammar.
    It is the process of creating step-by-step instructions a computer understands and needs in order for its programs to work.
     Learning how to code can not just help students become software engineers in the future, but rather help them develop a language skill which will be used in almost every field in future jobs.In order to make a computer understand your instructions, you need to choose a suitable means of communication. 
     Computers can only comprehend machine language (binary code). However, instead of learning to code in binary language, you can learn assembly language or other high-level languages.
      Assembly language, although much more powerful than high-level languages, is still a lot like machine language.
       Therefore, it is relatively hard to learn. High-level languages are very similar to the languages that humans communicate in, such as English.
        Hence, they make computer coding much easier.</h3>
